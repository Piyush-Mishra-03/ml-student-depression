# 🎓 Student Depression Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict levels of depression among students using machine learning techniques based on survey responses. The goal is to build an intelligent system that can assist educational institutions and mental health professionals in early detection and intervention.

---

## 📌 Objective

To develop a predictive model that classifies student depression levels into categories such as **Low**, **Medium**, and **High**, based on relevant mental health, lifestyle, and academic indicators.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Python 🐍
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (ML & PCA)

---

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset was collected via a student mental health survey and includes features such as:

- Age, Gender  
- Academic Stress  
- Social Life  
- Sleep Habits  
- Self-Esteem  
- Past Depression History  
- and more...

*(Note: All data is anonymized to ensure privacy.)*

---

## 📌 Conclusion

The Logistic Regression model performed slightly better than Random Forest, achieving over **95% accuracy** in classifying depression levels. The model could be deployed as a mental health early-warning system in educational institutions.
